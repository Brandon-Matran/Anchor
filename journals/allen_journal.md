Completed:
- added features/issues for sign up/log in, blogs CRUD, job listings CRUD
- updated api-design with blog "title" and job listings update and delete

Work in Progress:
- still need to figure out which db to use
- Discuss implementation of drop down feature and issues
- Discuss implementation of 'my Blogs' page and 'my Jobs Listing' page
- Ask instructors to review features and issues. Assign duties tomorrow

Notes:
Xue will work on Docker. Will discuss as a team tomorrow. Hope to have one endpoint modeled be Fri end.

## 01/03/2023

Completed:
    - created MAXBS group
        - added project members and HR instructors
    - resolved git pipline issue (hopefully); account validated
    - forked Project Gamma and renamed it 'Anchor'
    - basic api-design md created
    - installed black (lint)
    - basic wireframe drawn out, but modifications are sure to follow

Work in Progress:
    - create features based on the 4 MVPs:
        - Login/Sign Up
        - Blogs
        - Job Postings
        - CRUD
    - create issues for each feature and assigning members to issues
    - discuss changes to the MVP
    - decide on which db to use (PostreSQL or MongoDB)
        - I'd like to use PostreSQL because it's SQL and a relational DB

Feature preference:
    1. Blogs
    2. Forms
    3. Job Postings
    4. Log In/Sign Up

Note:
We are still at the beginning stages of the project. Need to discuss features and issues with the team tomorrow. Once everyone knows what they're working on, we need to organize the 'Board'. We also need to discuss pair coding and debugging sessions. I suggest we set up a 3rd column for 'issues' that needs debugging and setup timeframes for each issue. Maybe a priority scale can help organize the workflow once we start coding.
